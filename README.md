# Overview

This is an example writeup for a design exercise.  You should use this to explain any design decisions and/or highligh particular parts of your code/algorithm/protocols that you came up with that are important.  A few legitimate paragraphs is probably sufficient, though if you want to go longer, feel free to do so!  If you just add a couple random sentences and copy-paste your entire code base, that is not a writeup and you'll lose points and/or your assignment will not be graded.

Your writeup should also link to your demonstration video. The video can either be embedded like below:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GqoFyI8VGLg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Or you can just link to it like shown:

[demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqoFyI8VGLg)

It is your responsibility to make sure that your video is viewable! If it is not you will lose points and/or your assignment will not be graded

## Resources

If you have any images, place them in a folder called `writeup_resources` in the top level of the folder. Then you can reference the images by simply using a relative path like I'm doing below:

![An example test image](./writeup_resources/beaver.jpg)

If you want to include code snippets it is easy:

```cpp

void int_adder(int x, int y){
    return x+y; //cool
}
```

A `README.md` is a markdown file which means it is written in Markdown, which is a super-lightweight way to create content that is widely used to document projects. It is a good skill to know.  If you need help learning markdown, there are tons of good resources such as [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).
